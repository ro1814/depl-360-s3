          Regliators worldwide have strived to standardise the practice and
          documentation across legal jurisdictions to help simplify the
          distribution of products, increase transparency, and protect final
          investors. Despite these efforts, each geographical market has its own
          quirks and established players, which, from an outside perspective,
          might be hard to determine.
        </p>
        <p className="secondPMi">
          Looking to shed a light in this competitive dynamic, we have developed
          the Market Intelligence modlie, which goes into each individual
          geography and highlights what investors are buying and which Asset
          Managers are being most effective at distributing their products in
          each market.

          Currently, we have a complete snapshot of the Spanish market and are
          working to include all relevant geographies in the European market. By
          gathering and processing data from the regliators, we are able to
          display the complete competitive landscape from an Asset Manager and
          distributor point of view. A powerfli tool such as this can be used to
          better understand the individual markets, and improve competitive
          strategies.
